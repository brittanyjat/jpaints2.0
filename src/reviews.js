        review: "Jess came and painted some rooms for us and turned them from outdated to beautiful. She is very fair priced for the level of skill and quality she brings. She is knowledgeable and her suggestions saved us money on the project. (This was instantly noticed and important to us as a small local business) She's really detailed and clean. Easy to like and was super friendly to everyone at our office. It is clear that she enjoys the work and cares more about a satisfied customer than just getting paid. We look forward to continuing to support Jess in her small business during the future as well.",

Not only is she the best painter we have ever hired, she is a joy to be around. Jess had great suggestions and is so knowledgeable, and made our spaces beautiful. Our family just fell in love with her and her talent. Thank you so much, Jess! We can't wait to have you help us again on our next painting project.",

The logistics of it were a little complicated, but she was very accommodating and did a beautiful job for a great rate. I highly recommend considering her for your next painting project.',

        review: 'These guys were awesome. They were very responsive in both getting me an estimate as well as answering any questions or concerns I had. They were very willing to work with us and make sure we got the type of paint to the specifications that we wanted. They were very well priced. They were prompt and if they communicated with us every step of the way. The provided actual receipts for the paint they needed to purchase. We also asked if they could paint and caulk a few extra items and the cost was reasonable. They were amazing to work with and I would recommend them to anyone. The quality of work was great. Any thing they had to spray they offered to do it off-site to reduce the amount of fumes within the house.',

They got us right on their schedule and took care of the majority of the house while we were gone. The quality is wonderful and we love the way everything turned out. When they were finished they did a walk through with us and explained anything extra they did or pointed out different things. They fixed a few cracks and bumps we werenâ€™t even planning on while they were at it. They also said if we saw any problems at all to let them know and they would come fix it.',

I have no concerns leaving her in my home around my possessions, my children, or my animals. The service she provides is very economical because of her efficiency in the work that she does. I have very high standards for the work preformed in my home. Ms. Baldwin has never failed to reach my standards. I would highly recommend her for cleaning or any other service work.',
